<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? You can check out my demo here -> https://master--beautiful-brigadeiros-6a046e.netlify.app/
- What was your experience? My experience was very good creating this, tested my ability to work through things one step at a time
  and really see how things looked as I moved along and made things easier in the end when I needed to make adjustments.
- What have you learned/improved? I improved my work with the nth-child property and continued to working on my responsive abilities
  which still need some more practice but I am really happy with how this came out!
- Your wisdom? :) Definitely be aware of removing some css properties when using media queries as I took a while to figure out why
  one of my photos would not match up how I wanted until I realized the original css was still in effect since nothing was overriding it
  so I had to tell css to not do something when the media query takes over.
